# Realtime BART Display

## Description

A realtime transit display meant for a kiosk with no user interaction. It shows realtime arrivals of BART trains. It allows the user to select a station and choose whether or not to show background images.

It uses the [BART API](http://api.bart.gov).

## Who is it for?

The Realtime BART display is perfect for a coffee shop, office or other public place near a BART station. Showing people when the next BART train will be arriving lets them know whether they need to hurry to catch it or if they have plenty of time.

## Current Deployment

You can see the Realtime BART Display in use at [bart.blinktag.com](http://bart.blinktag.com)
